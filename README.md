# Sign-Cracker

Developer:
**Corey Edh**

Why did I create this?
I created this app to try out SwiftUI for my Artifical Inteligence class, 
this is my first SwiftUI app. The inspiration behind a baseball sign 
cracking app comes from Mark Rober and his [Sign Stealing app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmlRbfSavbI) 
however I written this with algorithm that guess the signs bases on how 
many time certain signs were used.
